# Digital Drive-Thru

This digital drive-thru is meant to demonstrate modern web development concepts by drawing parallels between a digital ordering system and a traditional drive-thru restaurant. This project is part of the AI Coding 101 series, designed to take viewers from having no coding experience to building full-stack applications with the help of AI.

## Project Overview

This application simulates a digital drive-thru experience, where each component represents a real-world counterpart:

- **Menu Board (Frontend)**: The user interface (`index.html` + `script.js`)
  - Just like a physical menu board, it displays available items and prices
  - Allows customers to select items and customize their order
  - Shows real-time order updates and total cost

- **Order Window (API)**: The communication layer (`server.js`)
  - Similar to a drive-thru speaker/window where orders are taken
  - Handles requests between the customer (frontend) and kitchen (backend)
  - Manages order creation, modification, and completion

- **Kitchen (Backend server)**: The business logic layer (`orderService.js` + `menuData.js`)
  - Processes orders and manages the cooking process
  - Handles inventory and ingredient management
  - Ensures order accuracy and completion

- **Pantry (Database)**: The data storage layer (PostgreSQL + `database.js`)
  - Stores menu items, ingredients, and order information
  - Tracks inventory levels
  - Maintains order history

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **API**: Express js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## System Requirements

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher
   - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Required for running the server and managing dependencies

2. **PostgreSQL**: Version 12.x or higher
   - Download from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - Required for the database
   - Default configuration:
     - User: postgres
     - Password: postgres
     - Database: drivethru
     - Port: 5432

## Key Features

- Real-time menu display
- Order creation and modification
- Item customization
- Order status tracking
- Inventory management
- Error handling and validation

## Educational Purpose

This project is designed as part of the AI Coding 101 series to help beginners understand:
- How different parts of a web application work together
- Real-world analogies to technical concepts
- Modern web development practices
- Full-stack application architecture

## Getting Started

1. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   # Create PostgreSQL database
   createdb drivethru
   ```
   (or download pgAdmin and do it manually as in the video)

2. Configure environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the server directory with:
   ```
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=postgres
   DB_NAME=drivethru
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   PORT=3000
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   Note: also consider using nodemon instead of running directly via 'node' so the server restarts when you make file changes.

4. Open the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ui
   # Open index.html in your browser
   ```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 for the API and you can access the UI by opening the index.html file directly in your browser.
